AI Humanizer Feature
Implement a text humanizer that transforms AI-generated content to bypass AI detection by injecting human-like characteristics.

Humanization Strategy
Core Techniques
Sentence Length Variation: Inject burstiness by varying sentence lengths dramatically
Vocabulary Diversification: Replace AI-typical phrases with natural alternatives
Structural Randomization: Break uniform patterns, add occasional fragments
Contraction Injection: Add natural contractions (it's, don't, can't)
Entropy Fluctuation: Vary complexity between sentences
Connective Reduction: Remove excessive transitions (furthermore, moreover)
Proposed Changes
Backend (app.py)
[NEW] HumanizerEngine Class
Burstiness Injection: Randomly split/merge sentences to create length variation
Phrase Replacement: Replace AI markers with human alternatives
Contraction Addition: Inject contractions at natural points
Structural Variation: Add occasional sentence fragments, questions
Entropy Balancing: Ensure fluctuating complexity levels
[NEW] /humanize Route
Accept text input
Process through HumanizerEngine
Return humanized text with before/after AI scores
Frontend
[MODIFY] user_dashboard.html
Add "Humanizer" tab alongside Upload/Paste
Input textarea for AI text
Output display with copy button
Before/After AI score comparison
Verification Plan
Testing
Test with known AI-generated text
Verify AI score drops to <20%
Ensure text remains coherent and readable
Test with various text lengths and styles
